# Nop.Plugin.Widgets.CSlider

CSlider plugin allows you to add unlimited slides with image, title and description to your NopCommerce powered website.

The client side is based on https://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/03/15/parallax-content-slider-with-css3-and-jquery/

The solution contains a WebSite (*\src\Web*) project which is a pre-built NopCommerce instance with a database in App_Data folder so you can start it from Visual Studio 2017.

If you just want to install the plugin: zip the folder *\src\Web\Plugins\Widgets.CSlider* and upload it to your site.
